Slack
=====

To join our Slack network, you can `get an invite <http://slack.writethedocs.org/>`_ automatically.

Our Slack network has a bunch of interesting folks hanging out and chatting about documentation.
It's the best way to connect with our community,
and to stay in touch with folks you've met at our conferences and meetups.

Below we have a bit more information about the useful Slack channels that we have.
This should start you off on the right foot,
and get you connected with folks who have similar interests.

We don't pay for our Slack, which means that the community has access to only the most
recent 10,000 messages. Not only is paid Slack prohibitively expensive for a community
like ours, but many people seem to feel a freedom in knowing that their words will disappear
shortly. Folks have also said that if the conversations were archived/published, they’d quit
participating.

You can `join our Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org/>`_ if you aren't already a member.

.. note:: Feel free to send a Pull Request to update `this page`_, if you want to include other channels.

Default channels
----------------

Everyone who joins the Slack will be added to these channels:

* **#general** - The main channel for documentation related conversation and questions.
* **#watercooler** - For talking about things that are off-topic. Get to know folks other interests that aren't around documentation :)
* **#jobs-posts-only** - Posting jobs. (You can look for jobs in **#career-advice**)
* **#wtd-conferences** - Questions and other thoughts around the :doc:`/conf/index`.
* **#meetups** - Questions and other thoughts about our :doc:`/meetups/index`.
* **#intros** - Introduce yourself! Let people know you're here, and why you care about docs :)

Other useful topical channels
-----------------------------

* **#career-advice** - Should you take that job? Am I being paid enough? Ask here!
* **#markup-the-docs** - Talk about markup languages. Markdown, rST, Asciidoc, etc.
* **#documenting-apis** - Talk about REST API's. Swagger, Apiary, API Blueprint, and other API doc tools.
* **#sphinx** - Talk about the Sphinx documentation generation tool.
* **#flare** - Talk about the Flare documentation toolkit.
* **#confluence** - Talk about everyone's favorite Wiki.

Location-based channels
-----------------------

We have too many location-based channels to list.
Chances are we have a large group of folks in your neck of the woods,
so join up and chat with them.
They're a great way to get in touch with your local meetup organizer and community.

Rules
-----

We have a few hard and fast rules that we ask people to follow on our Slack:

- **No Direct Pitches** - If you’re coming here *only* to make a sales pitch, please don’t. If you just put a link in the chat without any context or conversation, we will delete it.
- **No Brands** - If you're going to post, post as yourself, not as a brand. We are a community of individuals and we all exist outside of our day jobs and personal brands.
- **Use inclusive language** - Our community is multicultural, multiracial, multigendered, and generally diverse. When posting in channels, avoid using words such as "guys" to address a mixed group. Possible alternatives: "folks", "everyone", "documentarians".

Social rules
------------

Our goal with Write the Docs is to be **the most welcoming community on the internet**.
Documentarians tend to be empathetic people, which means that we should be good at communicating well.
People who are new to our community in particular should be assisted and welcomed.

We have a few guidelines that we hope people will follow when interacting inside our Slack network:

- **Only participate when you can be constructive** - Just because you can make a comment, doesn't mean you should. Try and be constructive in all that you do.
- **Say hi** - The world is a better place with a flood of hello's.
- **Don't be snarky** - We are all trying the best we can.
- **Be careful with jokes** - You know that you're joking, but some people might take you seriously.
- **If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all** - Once again our parents were quite wise.

Online community issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a specific set of behavior that is prevalent in online communities that I'd like to address.
I'd like to make sure we don't fall into these same traps.

In particular,
please avoid these behaviors:

- **No Black Sheep** - There may be tools that you don't like. There is a good chance there is someone in the room who either helped create or likes to use that tool. Don't make them feel bad, they are likely just in a different context.
- **Let Me Google That For You (LMGTFY)** - If people ask questions that are simple to answer on Google, still answer them nicely.
- **Question Policing** - Some people might ask incomplete questions that are hard to answer. Ask follow up questions and act in good faith to help them solve their issues.
- **Technology Competitions** - We don't care if your tool is faster or better in some metric. We care about creating great documentation for our users.

Reporting Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see people not following our etiquette guidelines,
you have two options:

* Message them privately, and explain why what they said might have been hurtful to someone, referring to this guide.
* Ask a :ref:`moderation-team` member privately to talk to the user, include a link to the conversation if possible.
